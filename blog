  <h1>They Told Me to Focus on Myself. So I Did.</h1>
  <div class="meta">June 1, 2025 | ADHD in the Workplace, Personal ADHD Insights/Rants</div>

  <p>I didn’t learn the importance of focusing on myself from some self-help book or wellness podcast.</p>
  <p>I learned it at work—<br>in a manipulative meeting<br>with bosses who couldn’t take accountability.</p>

  <h2>The Tension You Could Feel in the Room</h2>
  <p>There was something off in our team.</p>
  <p>Everyone was working hard.<br>But there was a heaviness—unspoken tension, awkward silences, the kind that makes your stomach tighten.</p>
  <p>I saw it. I felt it.<br>And eventually… I showed it.</p>

  <h2>The Private Meeting</h2>
  <p>One day, I got pulled aside.</p>
  <blockquote>“What’s going on with you?”</blockquote>

  <p>I decided to answer honestly. Not passive-aggressively. Not rudely. Just real.</p>
  <p>I asked if I could speak freely. They said yes.</p>
  <p>So I shared what I saw. What I felt.<br>I thought leadership wanted feedback, truth, clarity.</p>
  <p>But then came the corporate plot twist:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “You just need to focus on yourself.”<br>
    “If you want to be a leader, that’s not how you should act.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>(And by the way—I never said I wanted to be a leader.)</p>

  <h2>The Lesson I Wasn’t Supposed to Learn</h2>
  <p>Looking back, that moment taught me more than they meant it to.</p>
  <p>They weren’t trying to help. They were trying to silence me.</p>
  <p>They made the problem <em>me</em>—instead of addressing the real issues.</p>
  <p>They used “focus on yourself” as a shield against accountability.</p>

  <h2>So I Took Their Advice—But On My Terms</h2>
  <p>Yeah, I started focusing on myself. But not the way they wanted.</p>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>I focused on protecting my energy</li>
    <li>I started trusting my gut</li>
    <li>I realized I am a leader—not because I play the game, but because I’m not afraid to name what others avoid</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ADHD Doesn’t Make Me the Problem</h2>
  <p>It makes me <strong>aware</strong>.</p>
  <ul class="lightbulb">
    <li>I notice patterns</li>
    <li>I ask uncomfortable questions</li>
    <li>I care—sometimes too loudly for people who prefer silence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>ADHD doesn’t make me a bad employee.<br>It makes me sensitive to chaos, dysfunction, and fake leadership.</p>

  <h2>Reclaim the Phrase</h2>
  <p>If someone told you to “just focus on yourself” in a moment when you needed support—</p>
  <p>You can reclaim that.<br>You can flip it. Rewire it.<br>Turn it into your own kind of power.</p>
  <p class="callout">Because now? I am focusing on myself. And it’s making me dangerous—<br>in the best possible way.</p>
