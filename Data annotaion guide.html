        <li><strong>Build Clear Annotation Workflows:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Create personal checklists for each annotation type</li>
                <li>Document your most efficient processes</li>
                <li>Track which tasks you complete most efficiently</li>
                <li>Develop templates for repetitive annotation patterns</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Establish Consistent Routines:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Set specific hours for annotation work</li>
                <li>Create transition rituals between different task types</li>
                <li>Use timers to maintain awareness of time spent</li>
                <li>Build in regular movement breaks to refresh focus</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>Keyboard Shortcut Mastery:</h3>
        <p>Learning keyboard shortcuts for your annotation platforms can dramatically increase your efficiency. Many ADHD annotators report that the physical aspect of using keyboard commands instead of clicking through menus helps maintain engagement and increases work speed by 30-50%. Create a visual reference card with the most useful shortcuts for each platform you use.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Quality Control Measures</h3>
    <p>Implementing self-quality checks not only improves your work but also provides structure beneficial for ADHD:</p>
    
    <h4>Self-Review Process:</h4>
    <div class="checklist">
        <h4>Quality Assurance Checklist:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete initial annotation batch</li>
            <li>Take a short break (5-10 minutes)</li>
            <li>Review work with fresh eyes</li>
            <li>Compare against project guidelines</li>
            <li>Check for consistent application of rules</li>
            <li>Verify edge cases and unusual instances</li>
            <li>Submit final version only after review</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Performance Tracking:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a spreadsheet of your accuracy rates</li>
        <li>Note which types of errors you commonly make</li>
        <li>Document strategies that improve your accuracy</li>
        <li>Track your speed improvements over time</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="adhd-strategy">
        <h3>The "Calibration Session" Technique:</h3>
        <p>Many successful ADHD annotators use a "calibration session" at the start of each work period:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with 5-10 minutes of very simple, quick annotation tasks</li>
            <li>Gradually transition to more complex tasks as your focus builds</li>
            <li>Use this ramping-up period to "calibrate" your brain to annotation mode</li>
            <li>Track which types of "starter tasks" most effectively help you transition into deep work</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This technique leverages the ADHD brain's need for warm-up and transition time, rather than expecting immediate deep focus.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 id="security-privacy">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
    
    <p>Data annotation often involves working with sensitive information. Protecting yourself and the data is both an ethical obligation and a professional requirement.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Handling Best Practices</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Maintaining Data Confidentiality:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Never share or discuss project details outside of work</li>
                <li>Log out of platforms when not actively working</li>
                <li>Use secure, private internet connections</li>
                <li>Never download or store annotation data locally unless explicitly authorized</li>
